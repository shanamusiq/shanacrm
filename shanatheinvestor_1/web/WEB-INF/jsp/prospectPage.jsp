 <h1>Strategies</h1>
 <h4>Wholesale</h4>
 <p>Wholesaling is the most basic strategy that most new real estate investor use to generate quick cash. It is low risk, and does not require a substantial financial investment. When doing a wholesale deal, the investor finds a property that can be rehabbed or rented, places the house on a contract, and then markets to other rehabbing or renting investors for transfer.  The investor never “owns” the property, only holds/controls the property via the wholesaling contract, and receives a “finders” fee for the property when the property is sold.</p>
 <h4>Rehab/Flip</h4>
 <p>This is the most common strategy that is the center of many network television shows.  In this strategy, the investor purchases a property below market value, adds value to the property by upgrading (rehabbing) then sales at market price.  The strategy is a bit more complicated and risky due to upfront capital that is required for purchase, as well as the risk factors of the rehab and potential rising holding cost due to time it takes the house to sale after rehab is complete.  However, when done correctly, it can be very profitable yielding high dividends to the investor.</p>
 <h4>Lease Option</h4>
 <p>The lease option strategy is great for controlling property without having to own it.  There are various ways to use this strategy, but the most basic involves a contract with the seller to the investor which gives them permission to control the property. In most cases, the investor will agree to make payments on the mortgage and insurance, but the seller will remain owner for a given amount of time stated in the contract. After a period outlined in the contract, the investor has the option to purchase the property.</p>
 <p>This is useful when the investor does not have or want to tie up financial resources into the property. In order to generate profit, the investor can lease the property to a potential buyer to cover mortgage and insurance until they are ready to purchase.</p>
